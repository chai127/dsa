// copy constructor a special constructor in C++ that runs when you create a new object as a copy of another.
//If you don‚Äôt write your own, C++ gives you a default copy constructor.
//This does a shallow copy ‚Äî it just copies the pointer balance, not the value it points to.

//example:
// Account a(101, 500.0); // a.balance ‚Üí 500.0
// Account b = a;         // b.balance ‚Üí also points to a's 500.0
// // Later...
// delete a;  // deletes balance
// delete b;  // tries to delete the SAME balance ‚Üí CRASH!

//theres also a rule of five!
